# CV App

This is my first project using React and coding with JSX.

It is a simple CV builder app with input forms for three different sections. 
  - General Info
  - Experience
  - Education

Each form can be submitted and then edited with the Experience and Education portions also featuring the ability to add and delete jobs and schools. I achieved this by housing the input's form fields and their repective outputs on separate sections that when submitted toggle their 'display' from 'block' to 'none' so only one section is viewed at a time. 

It is primarily styled for Chrome but functions just as well on Safari.
